 * The first four bytes of index formats later than version 1 should
 * start with this signature, as all older git binaries would find this
 * value illegal and abort reading the file.
 *
 * This is the case because the number of objects in a packfile
 * cannot exceed 1,431,660,000 as every object would need at least
 * 3 bytes of data and the overall packfile cannot exceed 4 GiB with
 * version 1 of the index file due to the offsets limited to 32 bits.
 * Clearly the signature exceeds this maximum.
 *
 * Very old git binaries will also compare the first 4 bytes to the
 * next 4 bytes in the index and abort with a "non-monotonic index"
 * error if the second 4 byte word is smaller than the first 4
 * byte word.  This would be true in the proposed future index
 * format as idx_signature would be greater than idx_version.
